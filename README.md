# Hello Doctor

# PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
Overcrowding at hospitals and Poor management at hospitals and Deaths caused by bad handwriting in medical prescription and lack of info of medicine combination we need.

Let me elaborate, we live in the most populated country in world, how many times you got sick, went to hospital just to get checked, got a appointment and in the waiting hall there is a big crowd sitting in the waiting hall, and the doctor isnt arrived yet, or went to a surgery, or is on a half leave, or went to had lunch. To avoid this we trying calling the reception and get info, it works but sometimes their line doesnt connect, or the receptionist cannot answer during heavy work hours. We wait there hours while halting our works, just for a simple check. As we booked appointment, we middle class doesnt have a luxury to go another hospital. if you havent faced this either you are lucky or on the good side of city surrounded by responsible hospitals. but i faced a this a lot of times.

And we all face that problem that doctor hand written medical prescription are often illegible and that can be very fatal sometimes. Studies estimate that illegible doctor's handwriting is a major cause of medical errors, potentially leading to death in India, with a widely cited figure of around 7,000 deaths annually being attributed to this issue globally. The primary mechanism for this is confusion between medications, where a pharmacist dispenses the wrong drug based on a misread prescription, which can have fatal consequences.

And sometimes, specification patient require specific combination of medicines, which are available rarely at common places. And if its too late to garb hands on that medicines, they end up dead or even more critical position than they were before.


# SOLUTION :

so here, i propose a app "Hello Doctor ❤" that shows the availability of doctor and a avg no of people waiting in the lobby.

So This app has 4 pages:

# PAGE 1:

# HOME PAGE :

when you open this application, to shows hospitals near your location and you can select one. if you doesnt have your desired option, you could use the search box and get your pick. then it shows all the profiles of doctors who work and treat outpatients along side their speciality. and you chose your doctor. then it shows whats their whats their name, their speciality, their education, his Doc score (people rating on app), and his present availability at hospital. and the ai calculated no of patients waiting for him (this is calculated by the task explained next).
while viewing it asks whether you want to visit him. if you select yes it will ask at what time slot you might/want to arrive. and this info given my many people is used to determine and guess how many patients are waiting in the time slot. Then it ask the pateints name and his age. (problem will not be mentioned here and dealt when they meet doc). then they pay the fee acc to doc in their respective hosipitals + 5 platform fee. they will be given a e token. and they cant select their token. redund is available if they cancel before 30 appointments and after it you will not be refunded. if doc get a emergency and cancel his appointemnts for day, it will be refunded to everyone. Appointemmets for next day available and day after tomorrow. and beyond that no possible.
if you get a appointment, the doc gets notified. about token number, name and age. so they will call the appoints in order. doc can have a phone or laptop or computer. he will be given a profile thrhough his hooispital or clinic.
and after treatment he gives a e-prescription of medicines. and after you got treated you can give your rating to the hospital and doctor.

# BookMyShow approach :

so what we do is we create a software, where the hospital share the information about availability of doctor. most hospitals use digital in out check. so we can negotiate and get that info. they agree as it can manage the crowds. but backdrop is that it relies on human discipline.


# page 2 :

# Appointments Page :

if you book a appointment, you can see it here.
it will show what hosipital you booked, doc and you if click the doc it redriects to home page and show his profile again. what time you booked. and you can see a bell symbol, if you click it, you can set a remainder, for 1her or 30mins or 1hr 30mins. according to you.
below your appointment card, you can see to "get diresctions" and this redirects to google maps and show directions to your appointed hosipital or clinic

# page 3:

# med bay:

here, there is a search box, you type any medicine combination, and here is a camera lens and using that you can show your medicines and get its name. it will show in what what stores it is availbale. then you can either book and get it home deliver with 30 platform fee. if you click the store you are available and interested in, it redirects to google maps and show direction

how this works is, when a medical store get the goods, they record what what medicnes they got and at the end of day they record what got sold and what is left.
we access them.

# page 4:

# History page:

here is the all history of doc you visited.
and here you can see the report they give and e-prescription.
and beside each med, there is small i in circle symbol, and if you click it, you get basic overview of med and with note its not 100 accurate. at if you click on a medicine name, if asks whether you want to check where it is available, if you click yes, it redirects to page 3 and show what what stores it is available in.
and to this prescription, doc's nurse has a access and she can add the details of when to take.
and here we show a bell symbol and asks if you want to create a alarm

# NOTE
home page will have a tool bar of 3 lines at top right
there you can see your profile and change your language (but prescription language does not change)
